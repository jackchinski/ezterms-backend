To keep our Services safe and secure

We collect and store your information and, in
some cases, apply automated processing and
manual (i.e., human) review to maintain the
security and integrity of our Services. This
involves taking steps to detect, investigate and
otherwise protect our community against spam,
abuse, harassment, intellectual property
infringement, crime, suspected fraud, harm,
suspected violations of Etsy’s Terms of Use
and safety and security risks of all kinds. It is in our legitimate
interests, and those
of our Members, to
ensure the security of
our Services, to verify
accounts and activity,
to combat harmful or
inappropriate conduct
or content and to
detect, prevent and
address spam. It is in our legitimate
interests, those of our
Members and the
general public to
enforce our House
Rules, Terms of Use
and associated
policies, including to
prevent or address
fraud and other illegal
activities. ● Buyer Public Profile

To share information with law enforcement and
respond to legal requests
We may share your information with a third
party, including law enforcement authorities,
where not compelled by law when we believe
in good faith that such use and/or disclosure is
reasonably necessary to detect, prevent or
prosecute illegal activity or to prevent
imminent death or imminent bodily harm. The categories of information that we access,
preserve, use and share for these purposes
will depend on the specific circumstances.
