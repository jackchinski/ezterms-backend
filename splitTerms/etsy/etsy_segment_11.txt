In the event of a business reorganization
In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize
its business. In these types of transactions
(such as a sale, merger, liquidation,
receivership, reorganization, or transfer of all or
substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member
information is typically one of the business
assets that is transferred. Such transactions
may be necessary
and in our legitimate
interests, particularly

our business to

term. ● Buyer Public Profile
