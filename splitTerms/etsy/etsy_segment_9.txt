To display non-personalised advertising on
third-party platforms and sites
We use your information for non-personalized
ads for our Services on third-party platforms
and sites. For example, we purchase offsite advertising
from a network of participating providers, such
as social networks and search engines. See
the Etsy Offsite Ad Channels for further
information. You may see ads for Etsy on these
channels even if you have opted-out of
personalized advertisements. If you are a Seller, we may use information
about you in order to feature you in marketing
and advocacy materials, and to feature you and
your shop on and off the platform, as provided
for in Etsy’s Terms of Use.
