If we deny your request to exercise your rights, you may have the right to appeal our decision by contacting us using privacy-support@pinterest.com.

Anyone can see the public content you post, such as boards and Pins you create and public profile information you give us. Depending on where you live, we also make this public information available through what are called APIs (a technical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API. We also share the categories of information described above:

With other services, at your direction. For example, when you decide to link your Pinterest account to third party services, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to such services, you direct disclosure of certain information to those services. Creators may direct us to share information with advertisers or other partners for paid engagements. We share data for advertising and related purposes, including showing you ads about Pinterest on third-party services and helping advertisers understand how ads on Pinterest perform. When you fill out a lead ad form, weâ€™ll share this information with the advertiser as described in the form. With vendors that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by vendors on our behalf. With law enforcement agencies, government agencies, or other parties in compliance with the law.
