How long do we keep your information? We keep information for as long as we need it to provide a feature or service
But you can request that we delete your information
We’ll delete that information unless we have to keep it for something else, like for legal reasons

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products 


In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time.
