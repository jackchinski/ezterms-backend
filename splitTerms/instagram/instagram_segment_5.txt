To provide measurement, analytics and business services

Lots of people rely on our Products to run or promote their businesses. We help them measure how well their ads and other content, products and services are working. To provide measurement and analytics services, we use the information we collect about you across your accounts on our Products. Our measurement and analytics services help our partners understand things like:

How many people see and interact with their products, services or content, including posts, videos, Facebook Pages, listings, Shops and ads (including those shown through apps using Meta Audience Network)
How people interact with their content, websites, apps and services
What types of people (for example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25â€“34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering) interact with their content or use their services
How people use our partners' products and services to connect to Meta Products, the performance of their connection and networks and users' experience with them
