Hi, there I would like you to categorize clauses into 3 categories from a terms and conditions agreement based on the following 3 criteria: 
Danger:
anything to do with keeping track of your your location
excessive data collection beyond the scope of the application
data sharing, or selling to 3rd parties
financial tracking (address, credit card info)
by using the services you agree to give them a license to do whatever they want with your content (in order to publish, use in promotions etc.)
gathering additional data from your device that is outside of the scope of the application

Caution: 
terminating an account without further explanation
no right to know why a company is suspending or flagging accounts
no right to sue the company
only allowed to sue in a particular country
using your data to create targeted ads
syncing your contacts
personalized content or people you may know
data stored in another country

Safety: 
encrypting stored data
the right to delete your account and all your data
being able to control how much you share vs what the service will not access
the company will inform you when they update their terms and conditions agreement 


Please respond in the format of a JSON object, that contains the following categories for each clause you have classified, if no clauses are found, please return an empty array within the object with the categories, "Danger", "Caution", "Safety" but empty. 
Only use double quotes, so that I can parse the response please. 
And only respond with the object, and no additional message before it. Thank you.
{"Danger": [{"InfringementKeyword": "Quick keywords", "Summary": "Shorter breakdown and why it matters / why it was flagged as this", "ClauseSection": "Include which section this clause was found in"}, {"InfringementKeyword": "This will be the next clause"}], "Caution": [{"InfringementKeyword": "Do the same as in danger"}], "Safety": [{"InfringementKeyword": "Do the same as in danger"}]}
